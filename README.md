# Text encrypter

The challenge consists of building a web page that encrypts and decrypts text that will be entered by the user and present it in its encrypted or decrypted form, the objective of this challenge is to put.

##How encryption works

The vowels are changed for other words:

- The letter "a" is converted to "ai".
- The letter "e" is converted to "enter".
- The letter "i" is converted to "imes".
- The letter "o" is converted to "ober"
- The letter "u" is converted to "ufat"

## Challenge Requirements
 
Should work only with lowercase letters
Letters with accents or special characters should not be used.
It should be possible to convert a word to the encrypted version and also return an encrypted word to its original version.
For example:

```html
	"gato" => "gaitober"
	
	"gaitober" => "gato"
```
_The page must have fields for inserting the text that will be encrypted or decrypted, and the user must be able to choose between the two options.
The result should be displayed on the screen._
Additional features:
A button that copies the encrypted/decrypted text for the transfer section, that is, it has the same functionality as ctrl+C or the "copy" option in the applications menu.
